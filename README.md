## Overview 

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the principal public health problems of the 21st century that threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi no longer susceptible to the common medicines used to treat them. The problem of AMR is especially urgent regarding antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Over several decades, to varying degrees, bacteria causing common or severe infections have developed resistance to each new antibiotic coming to market. Faced with this reality, Machine learning methods are now commonly adopted by wet-laboratory researchers to screen for promising candidates.

## Goals

*Prediction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) based on contextual features in amino acid sequence. 
*Design new antimicrobial peptide.

## Specifications

This work is based on the paper : Deep learning improves antimicrobial peptide recognition.  Models and datasets are made freely available through the Antimicrobial Peptide Scanner vr.2 web server at www.ampscanner.com.

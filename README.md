## Overview 

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of small peptides that widely exist in nature and they are an important part of the innate immune system of different organisms. AMPs have a wide range of inhibitory effects against bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and the increasing of concerns about the use of antibiotics resulted in the development of AMPs, which have good application prospects in medicine, food, animal husbandry, agriculture and aquaculture. Faced with this reality, Machine learning methods are now commonly adopted by wet-laboratory researchers to screen for promising candidates.


## Goals

*Prediction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) based on contextual features in amino acid sequence. 
*Design new antimicrobial peptide.

## Specifications

This work is based on the paper : Deep learning improves antimicrobial peptide recognition.  Models and datasets are made freely available through the Antimicrobial Peptide Scanner vr.2 web server at www.ampscanner.com.
